# Working as student assistant (HiWi) in our team

Experienced students will be offered a job as student assistant (undergraduate research assistant) in our team. This paid work comes with great responsibilities since it is most of the time embedded into "real projects" :).

It is a big opportunity for you (the student) to learn more about how to do research and apply the skills you have been taught in the lectures.

We are very happy to have you as undergraduate research assistant in our team. Most of the researchers in our team started the same way many years ago. Research is hard - but it can be a lot of fun and a rewarding work.

## Prepare your documents for the contract

Again :): *A job as undergraduate research assistant comes with great responsibilities.*

If you have been offered a contract, our secretary (Ms. Stark, Weinholdbau Room 406) will contact you by email. She will ask you to prepare paperwork and drop by to sign the contract.

    Please respond to her emails within one business day.

If you do reply on time:

- the secretary will finalize the paperwork and forwards it to the professor and the HR department of the university
- the contract will become valid, you can start to work and get paid

If you do **not** reply on time:

- your supervisor will be informed about you not responding
- the contract procedure will be delayed and deadlines will be missed
- since there is a tight schedule with predefined days for deadlines this means that the contract can and will not be signed by the professor and the HR department
- since the deadlines have been missed the prepared paperwork becomes **invalid - automatically**
- the procedure will be stopped and another student will be given the opportunity to apply for this position

## Get a TUC user account

*This is relevant for students enrolled at an institution different from TU Chemnitz*

In order to access [Gitlab](https://gitlab.hrz.tu-chemnitz.de/) you will need a TU Chemnitz account. It is also useful to access resources available only from within the university network via VPN. You can get an account at the Universitätsrechenzentrum (URZ) if you are enrolled at any other German university. Just got to one of their offices (adresses and opening hours are found [here](https://www.tu-chemnitz.de/urz/nutzerservice.html)) and bring your **ID or passport**, **student ID** and your **matriculation certificate**. An account will then immediately be assigned and activated for the time of your matriculation certificate being valid. The account can be extended if you always send them your new matriculation certificate before the start of the semester.

## FAQ

**Q:** How do I get a contract as undergraduate research assistant?

**A:** You can check the vacant positions which are announced by the university Career Service. You can ask your professor. If a student shows outstanding results in the lectures he might get offered a contract.

Unfortunately there are only a limited number of positions available for undergraduate research assistants. The positions are very popular because it is an opportunity for young people to get in touch with cutting edge problems and topics which go beyond state of the art.

The easiest way to get a contract is to start working with a research group you find interesting by showing outstanding results in the research project or practical trainings. Show and prove passion as early as possible, which is right from the first semester.
